## Example Configurations

The examples assume you have your provider credentials in Terraform Cloud and you are using remote execution to access the provider credentials or you are passing the provider credentials as environment variables [through the `env` key on the action](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md#consume-secrets-in-your-workflow). Please don't use this action with the default `local` backend as the state might get lost and locking might not work.

## Limitations

This action is intended to be limited to a single stack. While you could pass `*` as the stack name and use multi-stack deployments, we don't currently support all the complexities of doing accurate plans across multiple dependent workspaces within the action.
